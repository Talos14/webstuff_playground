Playing around with websites and stuff, nothing serious. Just lil projects on my own as i learn html,css and js.


Feedback is always appreciated here. just a beginner right now.
I dont know many things yet, if you spot a mistake somewhere or some form of bad coding do point it out if possible. I'd be really grateful if you did.
